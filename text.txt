tesseract is use for the text extraact from the image/pdf/txt file. It is not designed for barcode/QR code recognition. We should use a barcode/QR specific lib.

khanamiryan/qrcode-detector-decoder
Reads QR codes only
Doesn’t support 1D barcodes (UPC, EAN, Code128, etc.)


synergi-tech/php-barcode-reader
Experimental — attempts to decode 1D barcodes
Slow, may be inaccurate
Not maintained actively
No CLI required

zbarimg (CLI) 
shell exe

ZXing (via Java bridge or shell call)
advance setup
